### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Robb Currall, an Senior Software Engineer at Vantaca. As a member of the "Rev-Up" team at Vantaca, I am responsible for overseeing the architectural design and implementation of an payment portal within the existing HOA management software we offer. This effort involves modernizing our infrastructure and designing new APIs to integrate with various payment platforms to handle card and bank debit transactions.

I am an experienced web application developer with a diverse range of skills and technologies, including C#, PHP, Java, and JavaScript. I am passionate about learning and staying up to date with the latest trends and developments in the field, and have recently been exploring Go and Rust to further enhance my abilities. I am always eager to take on new challenges and projects to continue growing and improving as a developer.
