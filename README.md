### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Robb Currall, an Engineering Lead at Hip eCommerce for the Catalog team, focused on applying image recognition technology to the collectibles space.

My expertise spans systems architecture and design, API design, general web application development, and leading Agile development teams. I also have worked closely with DevOps and have gained experiencing working with Kubernetes and building various CI/CD solutions.

In my current position, I am leading the Catalog team to build an image recognition solution for comics and integrating it into the marketplace application for sellers to leverage for listing comics, as well as building a new collection application based on the technology for collectors to track their collection and gain insights on the values of their comics.

I am currently a Dungeon Master and player in a weekly game of Dungeons and Dragons (5e), where cleverness, creativity, and a bit of luck are always present.
